# 🔧 AI-Based Predictive Maintenance System for Industrial Motors

## 📌 Project Overview
Unexpected failures of industrial motors lead to production downtime, safety risks, and high maintenance costs.  
Traditional time-based maintenance does not detect early-stage faults.

This project implements an **AI-enabled Predictive Maintenance System** that monitors motor health using real-time sensor data and **machine learning** to predict faults **before breakdown occurs**.  
The system supports **condition-based maintenance**, a key concept in **Industry 4.0**.
